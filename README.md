I have tried my best to include everything that I used in the history of this SIG, in hopes that primarily, it will help anyone in ACM to create something out of it, hopefully, better and more well-structured heh hehe.

If anyone outside of ACM finds this, my apologies.

Rough Planned Structure:
* Semester Title at UIC
          * Document describing the structure of SIG at the time (basic textfile)
          * Slides (usually pdf of my presentation, .pdf format obviously)
          * Presentation (has all the jazz/gifs/videos in them, .pptx format)
