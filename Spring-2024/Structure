What we will not be doing:
Prompt Engineering ChatGPT
Data Visualisation as an end goal
Learning ML in 21 days
Deciding on format:
Lesson-oriented (mixed with small programming activities)

Programming Activites: 
Smaller Kaggle Competitions: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?hostSegmentIdFilter=5 
Quick code activities which are less code-heavy
Models: https://huggingface.co/ 
Discussing research papers (might be able to get a PhD student to drop in)
Programming oriented (start with a lesson, but towards a semester long project, that will have to be decided early on)
<Need to shortlist topics>

Language: Python
Environment: Google Collab / Github [https://bebi103a.github.io/lessons/02/git_with_colab.html#:~:text=Google%20Colab%20has%20convenient%20Git,leaving%20Colab%20in%20your%20browser]

PyTorch (better for smaller scale compared to TensorFlow)
